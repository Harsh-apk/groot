üå≥ What is Groot?

Groot is an interactive command-line tool that scans any codebase and generates a comprehensive, context-rich overview. It creates a detailed file tree and outlines key code elements (functions, classes, components, etc.), producing a single, clean output perfect for pasting into a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini.
The Problem

When working with LLMs, providing good context is everything. Pasting individual files is inefficient and loses the high-level structure of the project.
The Solution

Groot walks through your entire project, intelligently ignores irrelevant files, parses the code, and combines the structure and key elements into a single, concise output. This allows the LLM to understand your codebase's architecture, leading to better, more accurate responses for debugging, refactoring, and feature implementation.
‚ú® Features

    Interactive CLI: A user-friendly, question-and-answer interface that guides you through the analysis.

    Multi-Language Support: Out-of-the-box support for Go, JavaScript (including JSX), Java, Python, Rust, and more.

    Customizable Analysis: Interactively choose which directories to skip or which file extensions to include.

    Multiple Output Formats: Generate a human-readable text report or a machine-readable json output for tool integration.

    Detailed Analytics: Get a summary of your codebase, including lines of code, file counts, and a breakdown of code elements by language.

    Self-Contained: The language parsing rules are compiled directly into the binary, so there are no extra configuration files to manage.
